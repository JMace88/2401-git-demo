# 2401-git-demo
This is my first go. Figuring things out.

When I make changes to my code:
1. Save the file(s) with the changes.
2. 'get add .' - add all files to be commited.
3. 'git commit -m 'Message about file changes'' - saves the commit to be sent to github
4. 'git push origin main' - sending the changes to github (origin) on the main branch.
